## Preliminaries

- Usually I have big differences in knowledge and abilities of the participants - please tell, if it is too fast or slow.
- I have lots of hands-on coding [**exercises**](http://web.math.ku.dk/~helle/R-intro/exercises.pdf) - later you can only learn on your own
- We have many [**examples**](https://www.showmeshiny.com/) - try them
- If there are questions - always ask
- R is more fun together  - strong proponent of
collaborative work!


## Adjustments for online course

- Quick 
- One slide - one example - 
- Easy to use




## Getting help on packages

```{r,eval=F}
# provides details regarding contents of a package
help(package = "osmplotr")
# list vignettes available for a specific package
vignette(package="osmplotr")
# view specific vignette
vignette("data-maps")
```
